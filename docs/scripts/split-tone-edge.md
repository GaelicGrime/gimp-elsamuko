# Split Tone Script with Edge Detection

This is a simple modification of the split tone script of tuxcomputers. It adds optional edge detection. I did also some clean-up and some encapsulation to avoid confusion with other scripts.  
Copy it into the [scripts folder](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/install-script-fu.html) from GIMP, you will find it then under **Filters → Colours → Split Tone with ED**.
