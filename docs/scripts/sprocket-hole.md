# Sprocket Hole Script

This script simulates complete exposed 35mm film strips with frame numbers, lettering, overexposed sprocketholes and [DX film edge barcodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DX_encoding).  
Copy it into the [scripts folder](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/install-script-fu.html) from GIMP, you will find it then under **Filters → Decor → Photo with Sprocketholes**. DX1 and DX2 numbers can be encrypted [here](http://imageaircraft.portfairy.town/DXsim/).

[Here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/28653536@N07/2809752964/) is another example.
