# Rainy Landscape Script

This script changes a dry landscape to a wet one. I scripted my tutorial from here:

Copy it into the [scripts folder](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/install-script-fu.html) from GIMP, you will find it then under **Filters → Light and Shadow → Rainy Landscape**.  
It doesn't have many options, because you can change them afterwards in the layers menu (CTRL-L).

If you like it, hug someone.
